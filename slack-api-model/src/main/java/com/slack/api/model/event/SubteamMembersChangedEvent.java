/**
 * The subteam_members_changed event is sent to all connections for a workspace
 * when users are added or removed from an existing User Group.
 * Clients can use the timestamp information to detect if they are out of sync with the user list.
 * <p>
 * Unlike subteam_updated, this only shows the delta of added or removed members and does not include a snapshot of the User Group.
