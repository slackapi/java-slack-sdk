/**
 * The im_created event is sent to all connections for a user when a new direct message channel is created that they are a member of.
 * <p>
 * This message lets the client know that a channel has been created,
 * but the client should show no changes based on this, just update its internal list of IM channels.
 * Usually this event is followed by an im_open event.
