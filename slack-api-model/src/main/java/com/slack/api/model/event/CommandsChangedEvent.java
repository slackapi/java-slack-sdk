 * The commands_changed event is sent to all connections for a workspace when a slash command for that workspace is added, removed or changed.
 * <p>
 * This functionality is only used by our web client.
 * The other APIs required to support slash command metadata are currently unstable.
 * Until they are released other clients should ignore this event.
