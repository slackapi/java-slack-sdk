 * A channel_history_changed event is sent to all clients in a channel when bulk changes have occurred to that channel's history.
 * When clients receive this message they should reload chat history for the channel if they have any cached messages before latest.
 * <p>
 * This message is most often triggered as the result of a channel data import by a workspace administrator.
